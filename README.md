Incorporates text, audio, pdf, image, and video data. Would like more assistance check the the. 

What It Does

This code showcases a comprehensive pipeline for processing a wide range of data types:
Text: Utilize BERT-based text tokenization and language modeling for powerful text analysis.
Audio: Securely process audio data with an advanced AudioProcessor class, opening up possibilities for speech recognition and sound analysis.
PDF, Image, and Video: Download and preprocess PDFs, images, and videos securely, extracting text and generating useful data representations.

How It Works

Data Collection: Download PDFs, images, and videos from specified URLs using secure data retrieval mechanisms.
Data Preprocessing: Process downloaded data into suitable formats for analysis. Securely process PDFs to extract text content, and convert images and videos into tensor representations.
Multimodal Integration: Tokenize text using BERT-based models and process audio data with an advanced AudioProcessor. Combine data through concatenation or attention mechanisms for multimodal analysis.
Model Integration: Load a pre-trained multimodal transformer model from Hugging Face's extensive model library. This step sets the foundation for advanced language modeling and data analysis.
